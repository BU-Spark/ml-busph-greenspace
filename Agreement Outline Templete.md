# Team Agreement Outline


Please consult this resource when designing your team agreement: 
https://questromworld.bu.edu/questromteamlearning/main/student-resources/advancing-the-team 

### Team Name: Green-Space

### Team Members:

## 1 Team Goals:

- What is your collective goal as a team for this semester? What do you hope to achieve together? (examples could be create a working prototype, launch a business, everyone on the team gets an A, etc. It’s important to be clear to rank order these goals in case there are trade-offs) 
- What are your team process goals? What are your goals for how you work together? (examples could include meeting weekly as a team and completing all assignments and deliverables by Sunday night, etc.)
- What are your individual goals? You might want to be clear about how you plan to show up as a teammate and articulate these through a set of individual behavior goals.


## 2 Team Roles:
Each team will have different roles. Also the same individual can take up multiple roles, and members can also decide to switch between roles. For the Spark! Fellowship, some of these roles are defined, specifically the designer and developer roles and later, the Agile Roles. Additionally, there might be roles specific to facilitating an ML project such as data engineer, data scientist, software engineer etc  . Think of the type of work you need to manage to complete a project and assign roles. 

### 2.1 devs



### 2.2 Designer

Which team members are playing a designer role? (note: ideally each team has 1 designer. If you have more than one designer, you will need to be even more clear how the work will be shared. For some projects, there may not be a need for a designer in the initial phases. for example: a designer might be needed when the group is starting to move from the exploratory phase to a product phase)


### 2.3 Agile Roles

Agile Roles (to be updated post-design sprint and all members will be part of the dev team): Who will be the product owner? Who will be the scrum master? Who will be the development and design team?



## 3 Process:

The team will want to establish clear processes and procedures for organizing and managing work and collaboration. You will want to consider the following questions in crafting your Team Agreement:

- When and how will work be assigned across the team?
- How will you communicate with each other? What are your expectations around communications and responsiveness?
-When will you meet and where will you meet, e.g. on zoom, in person, etc.? What happens if someone misses meetings or is frequently late?
- How will you make decisions? e.g thumbs up on slack, consensus, majority vote, etc.?
- How will you resolve conflict when there are disagreements?


## 4 Interactions:

Learning how to interact effectively and professionally can impact how you feel about your team. This section of the team agreement is designed to outline your collective expectations about how your team will engage with each other? 

- What type of interactions do you hope to promote?
- What interactions do you hope to avoid or are unacceptable? 
- When there is a conflict, what process or steps will you follow? 
- Will you have a process for providing regular feedback to each other, so conflicts don’t build up? 
- How will you make sure everyone’s voices are heard?

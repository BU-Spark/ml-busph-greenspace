Design team: Haodong Chen, Christina Xu

## 3 Processes:

### 3.1 Work Assignment

- Everyone will have the choice of taking on tasks that they prefer at first, while the team leader/scrum master will assign any remaining tasks evenly among team members. Designers will refine the overall project goals in coordination with the client and PM and prioritize tasks. 

### 3.2 Communication

Our main communication platforms will be Slack and Zoom.
- Everyone should respond to Slack messages within 24 hours. 
- All of our communication will be respectful and constructive.
- We will maintain the same standards for communication with the client and PM.

### 3.3 Meeting

- Weekly meetings over Zoom to plan out deliverables, discuss progress, and address roadblocks
- If someone misses meetings or is frequently late, the team leader will reach out to them to figure out why

### 3.4 Decisions

- We will make decisions based on majority vote. However, depending on the context, some members' votes will have more weight due to domain expertise. The product owner's vote will count as 2 for agile processes decisions while the designers' votes will count as 2 for technical decisions.

- We will communicate either in Slack or in person depending on which option is most easily accessible in the moment. If major disagreements arise in Slack, we will meet over Zoom or in person to compromise. 

### 3.5 Conflict Resolution

(1) Identify the root cause of the conflict. Sometimes disagreements occur due to miscommunication and get blown out of proportion.
(2) Seek common ground. Look for areas of agreement and common ground to build on, and focus on finding a mutually beneficial solution rather than trying to "win" the argument.
(3) Explore different solutions. Brainstorm and discuss different solutions to the conflict, and evaluate the pros and cons of each option.
(4) Make a decision with clear action steps. Once a solution has been agreed upon, take action to implement it and ensure that everyone clearly understands their responsibilities.
(5) Follow up. Check in regularly to make sure that the solution is effective and that everyone is satisfied with the outcome.

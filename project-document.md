## Overview

The goal of this specific machine learning project is to characterize ecosystem services (ES) disparities in K-12 schools in the US using satellite and street view imagery and ML image understanding techniques. 

1. Situation and current issues
2. Key Questions
3. Hypothesis: Overview of how it could be done
4. Impact


### A. Problem Statement: 

Outdoor greenspace has become a focus of attention to improve the kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) school environment and increase sustainability of school campuses. Greenspace provides benefits across a range of ecosystem services, but little is known about its impact on student learning in K-12 schools, due in part to the lack of interdisciplinary work necessary to study the full pathway from ecosystem mechanisms to learning outcomes benefits. Additionally, although scientists know there are racial and economic disparities in greenspace in environmental justice and communities impacted by historic racist practices (e.g. redlining), nothing is known about disparities in ES mechanisms. This project is part of several ongoing environmental health research studies at BUSPH, to study the impact of built environment and indoor environmental quality in K-12 schools on learning and health, with a sustainability and equity focus. 

### B. Checklist for project completion
- [ ] Review Project Description and determine questions or clarifications needed from the client. 

- [ ] Create a work plan with team and determine the breakdown of tasks into weekly sprints on the Trello board.

- [ ] Understand provided datasets through EDA

- [ ] Develop image understanding techniques to start producing the following information: multiple greenspace ES metrics related to temperature and air pollution (regulatory ES)  as well as physical activity and restorative capacity (cultural ES). 

- [ ] The results should show some kind summary or queryable demonstration of what greenness ES for all K-12 schools in Boston & Chelsea means

2. Deliverable 2


### C. Provide a solution in terms of human actions to confirm if the task is within the scope of automation through AI. 

_To assist in outlining the steps needed to achieve our final goal, outline the AI-less process that we are trying to 
automate with Machine Learning. Provide as much detail as possible._


### D. Outline a path to operationalization.

_Data Science Projects should have an operationalized end point in mind from the onset. Briefly describe how you see the tool
 produced by this project being used by the end user beyond a jupyter notebook or proof of concept. If possible, be specific and
 call out the relevant technologies_

# Getting Started 
## notebooks
- [00-eda.ipynb](notebooks/00-eda.ipynb) - visualizes aerial images
- [01-mask_rcnn.ipynb](notebooks/01-mask_rcnn.ipynb) - visualizes annotated data and demonstrates how to train Mask-RCNN on 50m school aerial images
- [02-unet_resnet.ipynb](notebooks/...) - inference results of InceptionResNetV2-UNet on 500m school aerial images. Demonstrates complete workflow of aerial images to a queryable dataset
- [03_google_map_fetch.ipynb](notebooks/03_google_map_fetch.ipynb) - results to fetch google map, google earth images. 
- [04-results.ipynb]

## data

We are using satelite images obtained from google map static api, as well as google street view to train our models.
